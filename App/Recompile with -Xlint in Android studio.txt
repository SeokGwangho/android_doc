Fix Android Studio "Recompile with -Xlint in Android studio" Warning:
-----------------------------------------------------

The message suggest you recompile with args -Xlint to get more warning details,
add these code to build.gradle (Project: project-name) File:


allprojects {
    tasks.withType(JavaCompile) {
        options.compilerArgs << "-Xlint:unchecked" << "-Xlint:deprecation"
    }
}




Then you can fix warnings by detailed messages.
For example, you can replace deprecated method with new method
(there always been a new method since old method has been deprecated).

However, sometimes we don't want change our code for some reasons,
we just want get rid of compile warning, you can add @SuppressWarnings("deprecation") in front of the deprecated method.
